# Neovim Configuration

A modern Neovim configuration built with `mini.deps` and focused on developer productivity.

## Keybinding System

This configuration uses a systematic approach to keybindings with logical categories and consistent patterns.

### Core Philosophy

- **Leader-based organization**: Most commands use `<leader>` prefix with mnemonic categories
- **Consistent patterns**: Similar operations follow similar key patterns
- **Dynamic context**: Some keymaps appear only when relevant (debugging, LSP)
- **Vim-native extensions**: Extend familiar vim patterns rather than replace them

### Main Categories

| Prefix | Category | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `<leader><leader>` | **Command Palette** | Quick access to all commands |
| `<leader>s*` | **Search** | All search operations (files, buffers, help, etc.) |
| `<leader>f*` | **Files** | File operations and navigation |
| `<leader>g*` | **Git** | Git operations and GitHub integration |
| `<leader>u*` | **UI** | Interface toggles and visual enhancements |
| `<leader>d*` | **Debug** | DAP debugging (dynamic when active) |
| `<leader>l*` | **LSP** | Language server operations (dynamic when attached) |
| `<leader>a*` | **AI** | CodeCompanion AI assistance (normal + visual) |
| `<leader>v*` | **Visit** | MiniVisits path management |
| `<leader>b*` | **Buffers** | Buffer operations |
| `<leader>w*` | **Windows** | Window management |
| `<leader>S*` | **Sessions** | Session management |
| `<leader>i*` | **Insert** | Text insertion helpers |
| `<leader>q*` | **Quit** | Exit operations |
| `<leader>m*` | **Mini** | Mini.deps plugin management |

### Smart Navigation Patterns

#### Buffer & Search Extensions
```lua
-- Extends vim's search metaphor
"/"            -- Search in current buffer
"<leader>/"    -- Search buffer lines (fuzzy)

-- Buffer navigation mirrors window/tmux patterns  
"<C-h>/<C-l>"  -- Navigate windows/tmux panes
"<S-h>/<S-l>"  -- Navigate buffers (same direction, buffer scope)
```

#### Quick Access
```lua
"<leader><leader>"  -- Command palette (prime real estate)
"<leader>sb"        -- Search buffers 
"<Esc>"            -- Clear search highlights
"<C-s>"            -- Save file
```

### Dynamic Keymaps

#### Debug Interface (DAP)
Keymaps appear only when debugging is active:

```lua
-- Always available (breakpoint management)
"<leader>db"  -- Toggle breakpoint
"<leader>dB"  -- Conditional breakpoint  
"<leader>dC"  -- Clear all breakpoints

-- Active only during debug sessions
"<leader>dc"  -- Continue/Start
"<leader>di"  -- Step into
"<leader>do"  -- Step over
"<leader>dO"  -- Step out
"<leader>du"  -- Debug UI toggle
"<leader>dr"  -- Restart session
"<leader>dt"  -- Terminate session
"<leader>dp"  -- Pause execution
"<leader>de"  -- Evaluate expression
```

#### LSP Operations  
Available when language server is attached:

```lua
"gd"           -- Go to definition
"gr"           -- Go to references  
"gi"           -- Go to implementation
"<leader>lr"   -- Rename symbol
"<leader>la"   -- Code actions
"<leader>lf"   -- Format document
"<leader>le"   -- Show diagnostics
-- + workspace and symbol operations
```

### Advanced Input Features

#### Smart Combos
Quick two-key combinations for common patterns:

```lua
-- Navigation
"ll"  -- End of line (g$)
"hh"  -- Start of line (g^)

-- Text editing (insert mode)
";;"  -- Add semicolon at end, keep cursor position
",,"  -- Smart comma spacing for parameters
"=="  -- Smart assignment with spacing
"::"  -- Type annotations with spacing  
"->"  -- Arrow functions/returns with spacing
".."  -- Method chaining
'""'  -- Context-aware quote wrapping

-- Quick escape
"jk"/"kj"  -- Escape from any mode
```

#### Multi-step Keys
Context-aware keys with cascading behavior:

```lua
-- Insert & Select modes
"<Tab>"    -- Expand → snippets → completion → tree → brackets
"<S-Tab>"  -- Reverse navigation through same chain
"<CR>"     -- Accept completion → handle pairs
"<BS>"     -- Handle pairs → hungry whitespace deletion
```

## Architecture Notes

### Plugin Organization
- **Core keymaps**: `lua/keymaps.lua` - Static, general-purpose mappings
- **Plugin-specific**: `plugin/*.lua` - Dynamic keymaps colocated with plugin setup
- **Context-aware**: `lua/autocmd.lua` - Filetype and buffer-specific mappings

### Dynamic Keymap Management
- Debug keymaps managed in `plugin/programming.lua` alongside DAP setup
- LSP keymaps in `lua/autocmd.lua` triggered on server attach
- Uses autocommands and plugin event listeners for proper lifecycle

### Conflict Resolution
- Systematic categorization prevents most conflicts
- Dynamic keymaps avoid permanent namespace pollution
- Mini.clue integration provides contextual hints
